                        <p> Hello there, my name is Enrique Medina Aguiar I am a student here at the University of
                            Northern Colorado.
                            I am currently Majoring In business administration with a concentration in Marketing and
                            minoring in Digital Marketing.
                            If one were to ask me what my greatest skills where I would list what my previous employers
                            thought my greatest skills
                            were
                            This is because the way that one is perceived in an industry is much more valuable than the
                            way we truly are.
                            So, I have been told that five of my greatest skills are that I am a very personable
                            individual, great at communicating,
                            delegating tasks according to other skills, analyzing what is working and what isn’t when
                            given data, and evaluating
                            what to do next with that given data.
                            Thankfully these are some of the things I can bring to the company.</p>
                        Some personal skills that I bring to the table
                        <ul>
                            <li> I’m very detail oriented</li>
                            <li>I am working on being Microsoft certified</li>
                            <li>I am fluent in Spanish</li>
                            <li>I work well when in a time restriction</li>
                        </ul>
                        There are plans that I have that can also be very beneficial I would first implement an
                        organizational design
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which will influence the performance standard</li>
                            <li>To attain a more formal division of labor</li>
                            <li>Use a functional organizational structure</li>
                            <li>Employees are organized through their skills. Each department is managed separately</li>
                        </ul>
                        Do a swot analysis which is usually for marketing plans but could be helpfull
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyze Strengths</li>
                            <li>Analyze Weaknesses</li>
                            <li>Analyze Opportunities</li>
                            <li>Analyze threats</li>
                        </ul>
                        We will also create an objective we will work towards attaining
                        <ul>
                            <li>Achievable timetables</li>
                            <li>Communicating through appropriate channels</li>
                            <li>Keeping staff motivate</li>
                            <li>Reevaluating the organizational design if necessary</li>
                        </ul>
                        Thanks For Listening
