                <div class="panel-body">On August 25th, 2020, Kyle Rittenhouse drove about 20 miles to a protest in
                    Kenosha, Wisconsin to the Black Lives Matter
                    protest after the shooting of Jacob Blake. Jacob Blake at the time was a 29-year-old black man who
                    was shot by police 7
                    times which had left him paralyzed from the waist down. The protest had turned into a riot, and this
                    is when Kyle shot
                    and murdered two white men and injured one more. Kyle Rittenhouse later ran past police during the
                    riot with his rifle
                    still strapped on to him and got passed with little to no problems, with police body cam footage to
                    prove it. The issue
                    being discussed at hand here is how the justice system dealt with Kyle Rittenhouse compared to how
                    the police dealt with
                    the Jacob Blake, Elijah McClain, George Floyd, and many more. Kyle has now been acquitted of all
                    charges on the base of
                    self-defense when compared to the fact that George Floyd was murdered on the street for a fake
                    20-dollar bill and was
                    never given a trial. One can see that although it may not be fully recognized the justice system is
                    corrupt and made to
                    work in the favor of white people. Many have said that there is to justice systems one for white
                    people and one for
                    black people; the system is working exactly how it was built to work.</div>
