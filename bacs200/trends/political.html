                <div class="panel-heading">Politcal Trends</div>
                <div class="panel-body">Years ago, in 1951 Malcolm X had brought a case to the United Nations named The
                    International Tribunal on Human Rights
                    Abuses Against Black, Brown and Indigenous Peoples. They brought the case to a panel of jurors since
                    millions of black,
                    brown, and indigenous people have disappeared, been murdered, and nearly exterminated starting from
                    1492 to the present.
                    Many people have also argued wrongs go beyond just the disappearances and murders such as with
                    colonization, racism,
                    militarism, imperialism, materialism, criminalization, patriarchy, neocolonialism, and internal
                    colonialism. This
                    neocolonialism refers to Prison Industrial Complex, the Military Industrial Complex, and the
                    privatization of other
                    social services such as healthcare. As well as Police killing, mass incarceration due to over
                    policing in certain
                    communities, political prisoners, environmental racism, and public health issues. As of this year
                    the case was finally
                    closed after hearing over 30 separate witnesses the United Nations found the United States guilty on
                    five counts of
                    genocide. The first being Police killings of black, brown, and indigenous people. Secondly,
                    hyper/mass incarcerations of
                    black, brown, and indigenous people. Third, Political incarceration of civil rights/national
                    liberation era
                    revolutionaries and activities, as well as present day activities. Forth, Environmental racism and
                    its impact on black,
                    brown, and indigenous peoples. The fifth being public health racism and its traumatic impacts. This
                    is huge news and a
                    big movement against the injustices here in the United States yet there has been little to no media
                    coverage on the
                    case. One must ask themselves why that is? Its almost like the United States does not what its own
                    people to know that
                    that have been found guilty of the Five counts of genocide and keep their people in the dark of what
                    is happening in
                    there very own country.</div>
