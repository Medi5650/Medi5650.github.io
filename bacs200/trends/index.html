            <div class="panel-body">I am Junior here at UNCO with Business Administration major with a concentration in
                Marketing and minoring in Digital
                Marketing. A few of my interest include but are not limited to painting, reading, cooking, fashion, and
                making old
                people angry. I tend to paint whenever I am feeling emotional and you can really see and feel whatever
                emotion I’m
                feeling, I see it as a form of journaling. Usually when painting I enjoy using multiple mediums to play
                with tones and
                add texture and dimension to the piece. I recently started reading more often because I don’t enjoy
                getting my ideas
                from the internet there is something more satisfying about reading something and interpreting it your
                own way to reach a
                conclusion that is unique to you. Cooking for myself is nice but I love to cook for a group I see it as
                a form of love
                language, here is something I made for you to enjoy; its quite fun. I see fashion not only as a form of
                self-expression
                but as a form of art as well, painting is another form of self-expression.</div>
