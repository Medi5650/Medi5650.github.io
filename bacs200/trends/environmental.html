                <div class="panel-body">One major environmental issue that we have been and are continuing to face is
                    overpopulation. As the population of the
                    human race continues to rise in combination with being able to live to quite an old age, we face
                    many problems. To start
                    off we are running out of areas to habit, we can not continue to the deforestation of the world in
                    order to keep
                    building areas for people to live or it may kill us. We are over farming in order to feed all these
                    people I believe
                    that the best way to go about both of these issues is building up. Building ecofriendly housing that
                    is meant to last
                    and is made with resources from the local environment instead of building apartment complexes just
                    to get them built
                    fast. These building could also use vertical farming and garden on the building that uses grey water
                    as the water source
                    as a way to combat deforestation and bring cleaner air for people. Unfortunately, due to
                    overpopulation we are also
                    running out of natural resources needed in or to sustain the amount of people we have. It has also
                    contributed to water
                    pollution which I believe can be solved through proper water and waste management. It has even begun
                    to affect our
                    economy widening the wage gap and having a detrimental effect on the poor. This is something we must
                    really focus on
                    trying to solve because if something is not done soon the effects will be permanent and there will
                    be little to nothing
                    we can do.</div>
