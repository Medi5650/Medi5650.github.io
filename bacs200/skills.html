# How to Tell Your Story


## Areas of growth

* I am lacking in the nitty gritty parts that add the trivial details that make the website look professional
* I will be taking a few more web design classes so I will continue to expand on my development there.
* I would say my current experience level is between competent and proficient

### Growth objectives

* I would love to grow my experience to proficient closer to expert
* I want to pursue a social media marketing internship

### Budget time Development

* My social life has always been particularly important to me and is a top priority. As of late I have stopped caring as much about it
* I have become more interested in working and creating personal projects outside of the traditional educational field.
* I will only develop my skills in the classroom setting I would not use my personal time to develop these skills in my personal time, it is not something I would want to pick
up as a hobby

## Plan

* My dream job would be to work on a creative team that does campaigns for a fashion company. With a digital marketing minor and a marketing major I believe these would come in handy

* To start I would like to get a social media internship down in Denver this summer And apply for another in San Fransico for the next summer

* From there I would continue to build my resume by working in sales before I could move to any other positions..
