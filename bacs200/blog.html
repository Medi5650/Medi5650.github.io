                <h3>Social implications </h3>
                <p>Low living wages have an effect on households as a whole, the low wages leave little room for any
                    kind of spending.
                    Poverty and being exposed to high levels of stress at a young age can have effects on a person’s
                    health. Which include
                    but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li> Mental illness</li>
                    <li>Risky behavior</li>
                    <li>Poor health in general</li>
                </ul>
                As a society we must relearn and let go of our prejudices or we may never be able to move forward and
                grow. It is up to
                us to strive to do better.</p>

                <h3>Economic implications</h3>
                <p>Social justice Inequality can have an effect on the quality of education that on gets, which in the
                    long run also
                    affects one’s social mobility. Social mobility is one’s ability to move up and down the social
                    classes in one’s society.
                    The United States is based of the American dream, but as the rich keep getting richer and the poor
                    keep getting poorer
                    it widens the wealth gap. Making it harder and hard to move “social classes”. This also inhibits
                    ones social spending
                    ability which means that most of the population is unable to put money back into the economy.</p>

                <h3>Political implications</h3>
                <p>This is an issue that is spread way beyond the borders of the United States of America. There are no
                    limits to the
                    effect that social justice inequality could have. It can cause distrust from the general population
                    towards the active
                    government. This distrust could lead to rebellious actions to impose the rule of the government to
                    enact change in the
                    society itself. We see this happen quite often, especially last year with all the power behind the
                    Black Lives Matter
                    movement and the abortion protest in Texas. When the government imposes oppressive laws or doesn’t
                    help in a time of
                    injustice the people will recognize that and fight back.</p>
