                <h3>Social implications </h3>
                <p>This is an issue that is spread way beyond the borders of the United States of America. There are no
                    limits to the
                    effect that social justice inequality could have. It can cause distrust from the general population
                    towards the active
                    government. This distrust could lead to rebellious actions to impose the rule of the government to
                    enact change in the
                    society itself. We see this happen quite often, especially last year with all the power behind the
                    Black Lives Matter
                    movement and the abortion protest in Texas. When the government imposes oppressive laws or doesnâ€™t
                    help in a time of
                    injustice the people will recognize that and fight back.</p>
